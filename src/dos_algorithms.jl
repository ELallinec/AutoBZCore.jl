    GGR(; npt=50)

Generalized Gilat-Raubenheimer method as in ["Generalized Gilatâ€“Raubenheimer method for
density-of-states calculation in photonic
crystals"](https://doi.org/10.1088/2040-8986/aaae52).
This method requires the Hamiltonian and its derivatives, and performs a linear
extrapolation at each k-point in an equispace grid. The algorithm is expected to show
second-order convergence and suffer reduced error at band crossings compared to
interpolatory methods.

## Arguments
- `npt`: the number of k-points per dimension
